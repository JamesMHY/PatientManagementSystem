# PatientManagementSystem
It is a Patient Management System Project for clinic to use. There are some different roles of users. In addition, the system should record all appointments, in particular patient specific notes, and prescriptions. A doctor may review an individual patient record: neither an administrator nor a secretary should be able to access this record. During an appointment, the doctor will log in to the system and make notes. They may also prescribe medicines (with required quantity) and recommend dosages. If medicines were prescribed, a patient may see a secretary andcollect appropriate medicines. The secretary will then update the system to update the stock of medicines. At this point, the secretary may replenish the stock. If a prescribed medicine is not available, then the patient must be notified to come back when the stock has been replenished by a secretary.
